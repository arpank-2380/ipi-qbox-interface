This is python-3 version  of i-PI-Qbox interface.
#--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) If Kohn-Sham Eigenvalues are calculated, this will be send to i-PI as a string
    Extra string sending is made very flexible. Currently eigenset and iteration timing is implemented. 
    But others can be implemented very easily. 
    In qbox.py there is a line:
    self.extra_tree_list = ['./iteration/eigenset','./iteration/timing'] 
    Here in this list just add the other lists.
    Also Extra can now be sent in either (i) xml or (ii) json format. 
    For the latter, installed python version must have "xml2dict" package.

(2) A series of qbox plot commands can be utilized to store wave functions, densities.
    It must be supplied as a list.
    plot_cmd = ["plot -wf n1 file_prefix_1", "plot -wf n2 file_prefix_2"]
    file_prefix should determine the prefix of the filename and should not contain .cube extension.
    Interface would create a directory named cube_files where all cube_files would be stored.
